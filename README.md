### Entity-Relationship Model and Tables
Tables were created for Movies, Copies, Orders, Customers, Employees.
Personal information is stored about all the customers and employees in the database, and the user of the application is able to add new customers and employees within certain interfaces of the application.
The user of the application is able to create new orders, new movies in the database, view amounts of copies available and view sales reports of employees. The user is also allowed to view information specific to each user, employee and movies.

### Login Screen
The user is presented with a login screen, and prompted to enter a username and password. The user can then specify if the user is a customer or an employee. The username and password are checked against either the ***Customer or Employee*** tables in our database. If the username and password match an entry in the table, the user is presented with the next screen.

### Users Page
The user is presented with multiple tabs with different functionality. Users are able to add new employees or customer accounts and view info about accounts. Each of these different sets of features are shown on different tabs. Each user specified has specific info that is displayed to the user.
### Reports Page
The user can view a sales report, that displays a table of sales based on employee sales or customer rentals. The user can view overdue items from this page as well.
